# Impfmon

## About

Impfmon is a chrome extension that polls impfstoff.link for new appointments and sends you a notification + opens a tab if desired when one is found.
It also allows you to specify a max date for an appointment if you have time constraints or simply want to find a better date.

## How to install

If you trust me, you can simply download the `dist.crx` file and drag and drop it into your chrome extension window.  
This should install it and you are good to go.

## How to configure

You can click on the extension icon and then 'Options' to configure if a tab should be opened automatically, how often to poll, and what your max desired date is.
